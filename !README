brace / CZ

   Brace is a dialect of C which looks like python.  It has two types of
   coroutines, hygenic macros, header generation, graphics and sound.

   Brace 2 might be renamed as CZ, after I finish rewriting the translator.

   Brace is developed mainly on Debian GNU/Linux, but also works on various
   other *nix with GNU tools and X11, and on MS Windows with MinGW+msys.
   It should also work on OS X with X11, but I have not tested this.  The
   Windows version is only slightly inferior to the Unix version.


Dependencies

   Brace depends on gcc, make and libpng.
   On *nix, it also depends on libx11 and libxext.
   On MS Windows, get msysgit, which includes MinGW+msys and other stuff.
   I hear it does not build on OS X yet.  If you try you will need X11.
   On Debian: apt-get install build-essential devscripts fakeroot debhelper \
     libx11-dev libxext-dev libio-string-perl libpng12-dev


Building and Installing

   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local && make && sudo make install

   on Debian: debuild -b ; sudo dpkg -i ../brace*.deb


Examples

   WARNING - to exit full-screen example programs, press Escape!

   There are examples in eg/ and two slideshows about CZ with pretty demos:
     cd eg
     ./hello
     ./hello.bb
     ./star
     ./show slides1.txt 
     ./show slides2.txt 

   Some of the examples might not be in working order at any given time!


Documentation

   There is almost no documentation yet.  Have a look at eg/slides1.txt, the
   examples, the generated .bh files which are installed in /usr/local/include
   or similar, and perhaps the library source code in lib.  If you would like
   to read some tutorial or documentation for Brace, please let me know and I
   will write something.
