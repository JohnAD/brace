  Brace is a dialect of C which looks like python.  It has two types of
  coroutines, hygenic macros, header generation, graphics and sound.

  Brace is developed mainly on Debian GNU/Linux, but also works on at least
  FreeBSD, NetBSD and Open Solaris with X11, and on MS Windows with MinGW+msys.
  It should also work on OS X with X11, but I have not tested this yet.  It has
  been built on GNU Hurd and OpenBSD in the past.  The Windows version is
  almost as good as the *nix version.

  Brace 1 (coming soon!) will have binary packages for these platforms.
  Brace 2 will be renamed CZ, when I finish rewriting the translator.
    It will build and run with gcc or tcc; it will not use sh, perl or make.


Dependencies

  Brace depends on gcc, GNU make and libpng (which needs zlib).
  On GNU/Linux/Unix, it depends on libx11 and libxext (on windows it uses GL).
  On Debian: apt-get install build-essential devscripts fakeroot debhelper \
                     libx11-dev libxext-dev libio-string-perl libpng12-dev
  On RedHat: yum install libX11-devel libXext-devel perl-IO-String libpng-devel
  On *BSD: use pkg_add / pkgsrc to install dependencies.  FIXME list here!
  On MS Windows, get msysgit (fullinstall), which includes MinGW+msys etc,
    and get libpng, zlib from the GNUWin32 project, the bin and lib pkgs.
  It hear it does not build on Mac OS X yet.  If you try you will need X11.


Building and Installing

  ./configure && make && sudo make install              # or gmake
  # ./configure && gmake && sudo gmake install          # on *bsd etc
  # ./configure --prefix=/usr/local                     # default
  # debuild -i -b -us -uc ; sudo dpkg -i ../brace*.deb  # on Debian


Examples

  WARNING - to exit full-screen example programs, press 'q' (was Escape).

  There are examples in eg/ and two slideshows about CZ with pretty demos:
    cd eg
    ./hello
    ./hello.bb
    ./star
    ./lattice
    ./show slides1.txt 
    cd yukon ; ./yukon

  Some of the examples might not be in working order at any given time!
  Most of them do work on both *nix and MS Windows.
  There are many small examples with animated graphics.
  My webserver tachyon is written in brace:  http://sam.nipl.net/code/tachyon
  The brace library libb is written in brace:  brace/lib


Documentation

  There is almost no documentation yet.  Have a look at eg/slides1.txt, the
  examples, the generated .bh files which are installed in /usr/local/include
  or similar, and perhaps the library source code in brace/lib.  If you would
  like to read some tutorial or documentation for Brace, please let me know
  and I will write something.
