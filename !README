   brace / CZ

   Brace is a dialect of C which looks like python.  It has coroutines,
   hygenic macros, header generation, and libraries with graphics and sound.

   Brace will be renamed as CZ after I finish rewriting the translator in CZ.

   There are examples in eg/ and two slideshows about CZ with pretty demos:
     cd eg
     ./show slides1.txt 
     ./show slides2.txt 

   Some of the examples might not be in working order at any given time!

   You can build the Debian package with:

     debuild -b

    or

     fakeroot debian/rules binary


   otherwise, try

     ./configure
     make
     make install
