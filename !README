brace (0.9.9~wip)

  Brace is a dialect of C which looks like python.  It has two types of
  coroutines, hygenic macros, header generation, graphics and sound.

  Brace 1 (coming soon!) will have binary packages.
  Brace 2 will be renamed CZ, when I finish rewriting the translator.

  Brace is developed mainly on Debian GNU/Linux, but also works on various
  other *nix with GNU tools and X11, and on MS Windows with MinGW+msys.
  It should also work on OS X with X11, but I have not tested this.  The
  Windows version is only slightly inferior to the Unix version.


Dependencies

  Brace depends on gcc, make and libpng (which needs zlib).
  On GNU/Linux/unix, it depends on libx11 and libxext (on windows it uses GL).
  On Debian: apt-get install build-essential devscripts fakeroot debhelper \
                     libx11-dev libxext-dev libio-string-perl libpng12-dev
  On RedHat: yum install libX11-devel libXext-devel perl-IO-String libpng-devel
  On MS Windows, get msysgit (fullinstall), which includes MinGW+msys etc,
  and get libpng, zlib from the GNUWin32 project: bin and lib pkgs.
  I hear it does not build on Mac OS X yet.  If you try you will need X11.


Building and Installing

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local && make && sudo make install

  on Debian: debuild -b ; sudo dpkg -i ../brace*.deb


Examples

  WARNING - to exit full-screen example programs, press Escape!

  There are examples in eg/ and two slideshows about CZ with pretty demos:
    cd eg
    ./hello
    ./hello.bb
    ./star
		./lattice
    ./show slides1.txt 
    cd yukon ; ./yukon

  Some of the examples might not be in working order at any given time!
	Most of them do work on both Linux and Windows (at least).
  There are many small examples with animated graphics.


Documentation

  There is almost no documentation yet.  Have a look at eg/slides1.txt, the
  examples, the generated .bh files which are installed in /usr/local/include
  or similar, and perhaps the library source code in lib.  If you would like
  to read some tutorial or documentation for Brace, please let me know and I
  will write something.
