How to play this Yukon computer game

  Drag with the left button to move a card or stack of cards.

  X - exit game / start a new game.

  Escape - exit the program.

  Right click to move a card or stack of cards to the foundations.

  Right click on a King to move all possible cards to the foundation.

	W - hint (what move).  The first hint is the best one.  Press W again for
  other moves.  You can also left-click "show hint".

  M - move.  The computer will move for you, using the previous shown hint or
  the best move.  You can also right-click "show hint".

  P - auto-pilot.  The computer will play.  It tries to win without cheating.
  It follows the strategy described here:
    http://www.solitairecentral.com/articles/YukonSolitaireStrategyGuide.html
  It wins many games but not 80% as claimed on that website!  Auto-pilot will
  stop if it wins, or when it thinks it can't win and it can't make any more
  sensible moves.  You can press P again to turn it off.  The AI could be
  improved.

  F - fast mode.  Animations are disabled so the auto-pilot and hints will work
  faster.  Press F again to disable fast mode.

  Up and Down arrow - speed up or slow down the animations.

	To change a card, click it, then type a new rank and suit, like AH -> Ace of
  Hearts, 9S -> Nine of Spades, KD -> King of Diamonds, TC -> Ten of Clubs.

	You can change many cards in sequence, going down the columns.  At the start
	of a new game, you can start typing cards from the top-left card immediately.
  Whenever a new card is revealed, you can immediately type what it should be.
