To play rocks...

On a MS Windows machine:
	1. Download and install python 2.2.2 from http://python.org/
	2. Double click the `rocks.py' or `rocks.old.py' programs.

On a Linux / UNIX / Mac OS X machine:
	You can also download rocks.py and play it.
	Or, you can use `brace' to build the C++ version from `brace.b'.
	You would need to download and compile /brace which might not be very easy!

Have fun!

Please contact me if you like rocks or want to report a bug or give me a
patch or if you can't get it to work, or just for a chat.  Thanks!
