To play rocks...

On a MS Windows machine:
	1. Download and install python 2.2.2 from http://python.org/
	2. Double click the `rocks.py' or `rocks.old.py' programs.

On a Linux/i386 machine:
	You can simply execute `rocks', it's already compiled for your machine.

On a UNIX or Mac OS X machine:
	1. To build the C++ version, you will need the X11 development libraries.
	2. Remove the existing `rocks' executable.
	3. Type `make'.
	4. Now you can run `rocks'.
	5. To run one of the python versions of rocks, you need python 2.2.2,
		and Tkinter (the Python Tk interface).
	6. Then you should be able to simply execute `rocks.py' or `rocks.old.py'.

If you want to use `brace' to build the C++ version from `brace.b',
you'll need to compile brace.  The source code `brace.b' and the C version
`brace.c' for bootstrapping are included in this package.

Have fun!

Please contact me if you like rocks or want to report a bug or give me a
patch or just for a chat.  Thanks!
