struct foo bar -> typedef foo bar foo bar!!!?


tries to include files from cwd instead of directory where src is:
  
  $ cd brace/lib
  $ ../eg/nl.b
  could not find include file: ./b.bh
  br compile failed...
  $
  
  (fixed I think - it stills prefers files from currect directory compared to libraries, but that is ok I think)


can't return a struct from a function, because it adds ';' on the end of the
function!


there is some bug when compiling brace, where a half-written bh header file can
be left there to confuse subsequent makes


TODO hack around "decl may not follow label or case" bogosity in C.


port buffer in, out   # does not work


macros should expand to single lines somehow, so that #line still works right
