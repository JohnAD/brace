if someone uses io.h, they don't get printf(...) for free.
Perhaps they should.  We could write

	export <stdio.h>

for ones that should be exported

or

	static <stdio.h>

for ones that shouldn't be exported

the latter is more consistent with existing C

[ I chose to use export at the moment, probably local might be better. ]



use `use foo.h' or `import foo.h' or `module foo.h' or something instead of `<foo.h>'

[ I used `use foo' - nice & simple, if a bit DWIMMY :) ]
