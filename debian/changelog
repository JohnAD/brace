    to build geon.
  * includes GL graphics for win32

  * wrote sleep_step and asleep
  * wrote bm routines (benchmark)
  * fixed linux/sound dsp_buf was allocate too big, now synth works better

brace (0.9.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * compiling and working on gnu/linux, netbsd, openbsd, freebsd, gnu/hurd and
    hopefully still on mingw with unxutils ...

brace (0.9.5) unstable; urgency=low

brace (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed hash.b so it works, with hashtest.b
  * fixed bug in tokenizer with floats
  * TODO remove loudmouth / jabber support, remove C++ library
  * there is a bug in stdc.b   or in gcc/ld/libc6 ?
    workaround: removed "Atexit" throughout
  * extern "C" blocks were broken, fixed
  * persuaded to support other compilers, specifically tcc.
    let(...) won't work yet due to GNU-only "typeof".. wait, yes it does!
    woot! :)
  * make possible to disable the "incredibly dodgy and only partly complete
    line number" thing.  improved that a bit too
  * fixed build process for brace components: brace_rm_comments_blank, etc
  * working on parse.b  :O)  going well  :O)
  * renamed "vector" to "vec"  maybe do "buffer" to "buf" also?
    or should it be "vect" or "vectr" or something longish?  need a standard
    for type names vs. default variable names.  I guess vec -> v  buf -> b
    are ok.
  * fixed brace_mk_cc recursion problem to get "graph" to work
  * examples: I put almost all the brace code I've written in eg/  :)
  * fixed various issues that stopped it working with gcc 4
  * fixed ResolveDeps.pm to get "rocks" (C++) to work again
  * fixed mk etc to get "geon" to work again :)
  * fixed Include.pm to get "graph" to work :)
  * hacked around a syntax change in GNU "find" in utils/lsx and mk-clean
  * renamed deque to deq
  * added some functions from examples to libraries
  * more work on hashtables, split, tsv, for_foo etc.
  * sym.b, tok.b (maybe tok.b is not useful)
  * clean the eg directory
  * fixed a bug (use va_copy), now it works on powerpc :)
  * porting so it can work on mingw and linux and *bsd...
  * new "use" semantic will load ALL matching *.b files,
    and can also add a directory to the search path.
    The orignal intention of this is to support porting cleanly.
  * sort of fixed bug in Strip.pm with array typedefs
  * fixed strdup -> Strdup

brace (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * added an incredibly dodgy and only partly complete line number
    preservation thingy brace_number_lines.  hopefully this will help with
    debugging more often than it causes utter confusion :p
