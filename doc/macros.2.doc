Now I want block-level macro parameters!

I want to be able to say, for example:

define forever
	while 1
		...
	.

speaking of ".", maybe the default should be for the macro to
end at the same level it started, but a dot on the last line can
be used to change that.  (or the first line?)

It would be good to be able to define general syntactic forms:

define
	while(cond)
		(body)
	else
		(last)
as
	repeat
		if !cond
			last
			break
		body


define
	foreach(i, sequence)
		(body)
as
	it = sequence.begin()
	end = sequence.end()
	for ; it != end ; ++it
		i = *it
		(body)

define
	channel(type)
as
	struct channel_^^type
		rendezvous r
		type d
